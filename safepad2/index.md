<sub>Note that SafePad 2 versions prior to 2.06 will no longer automatically find updates. This is because Microsoft changed the link format for OneDrive meaning the link that older versions of SafePad 2 used to check for updates no longer works. Version 2.06 onward use a new link hosted here at arjailer.uk</sub>
