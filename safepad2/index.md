<sub>Note that SafePad versions prior to 2.06 will no longer automatically find updates. This is because Microsoft changed the link format for OneDrive meaning the link that older versions of SafePad 2 used to check for updates no longer works. Version 2.06 onward use a new link hosted here at arjailer.uk</sub>
