## Grind

[Download Grind 1.17](https://github.com/Arjailer/arjailer.github.io/releases/download/Grind-1.17/Grind.Setup.exe)

Grind needs .NET Framework 4.5.2 on Windows 7 or later

---

Grind is a grep _(global / regular expression / print)_ tool for Windows 7 and above.

I started writing it in early 2012 from a desire for a simple, fast, effective grep tool, primarily for my own use. There was also a more self-serving technical motive - I wanted to put some of the technologies I'd been learning into practice - things like WPF MVVM, the Managed Extensibility Framework, the Task Parallel Library, and Async and Await.

I have vague plans to make Grind open source one day ... but no promises ...
