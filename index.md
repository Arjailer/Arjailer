I'm a C# Windows coder by profession and these are some of my more interesting side-projects

<br/>

[Grind](/grind), a grep tool

[SafePad 2](safepad2.md), an encrypted text editor

[Gun Wing](gunwing.md), a simple little shoot-em-up that I wrote a long time ago

<br/>

_(they're all for Windows)_
