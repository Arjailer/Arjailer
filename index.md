Grind is a grep _(global / regular expression / print)_ tool for Windows 7 and above.

It was born in early 2012 from a desire for a modern, simple, fast, effective grep tool, primarily for my own use. There was also a more self-serving technical element - I wanted to put some of the technologies I'd been learning into practice - things like WPF MVVM, the Managed Extensibility Framework, the Task Parallel Library, and Async and Await.

Grind needs .NET Framework 4.5.2 and Windows 7 or later

I have vague plans to make Grind open source one day ... but no promises ...
